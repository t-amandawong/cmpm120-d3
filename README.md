This is a golf game in which you drag the golf ball the opposite direction of your desired hit.

The game uses both continuous and discrete inputs from the player: continuous-uses player's mouse position and drag to calculate the velocity of the ball, discrete-button presses throughout the intro and ending scene of the game

The playerâ€™s goal can only be achieved indirectly (by allowing the physics engine to move key objects into position/contact): using arcade physics on the ball

3+ physics-based gameplay scenes (possibly implemented with a single Phaser Scene subclass) - only 1 scene so far.

Other scenes are used to separate and contextualize the gameplay scenes - intro and summary scenes.

All assets made by me.
